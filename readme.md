# Heartbeatmatch

Heartbeatmatch generates a playlist using the heartrate from a Garmin gps/heartrate monitor track.

The gps/heartrate data is parsed using [BeautifulSoup](), the [Echonest api](http://developer.echonest.com/)is then used for finding tracks with the given bpm's and the [Deezer api/player](http://developers.deezer.com/) is used for playing back the playlist.
